<p> The Bronx Mόvil is a project of cooperative mutual aid that has become a harm reduction organization since 2018. It is based on providing street services, fully bilingual, with a particular focus on users who consume drugs intravenously from the Latinx community. Since September, the Bronx Mόvil  is now fully active 24 hours a day, 7 days a week after only operating during the weekends for the past five years.</p>
